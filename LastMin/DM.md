## Propositional Logic

Propositional Logic deals with propositions (simple declarative statements) that can be either true or false.

### Operators in Propositional Logic

| Operator | Term | Precedence |
|--------|------|------------|
| ¬ | Negation (NOT) | 1 |
| ∧ | Conjunction (AND) | 2 |
| ∨ | Disjunction (OR) | 3 |
| → | Implication | 4 |
| ↔ | Double Implication | 5 |

### Propositional Statements and Meanings

- if p, then q → p implies q  
- p only if q → p is sufficient for q  
- q if p → q is necessary for p  
- q follows from p  
- q provided that p  

### Truth Table

| p | q | ¬p | p∧q | p∨q | p→q | p↔q |
|---|---|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| T | T | F | T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F | T | F | F |
| F | T | T | F | T | T | F |
| F | F | T | F | F | T | T |

### Implication
p → q means if p is true then q must be true.

### Biconditional
p ↔ q means p and q are true or false together.

## Laws in Propositional Logic

### De Morgan’s Laws
¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q  
¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q  

### Commutative Laws
p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p  
p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p  

### Associative Laws
p ∨ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∨ r  
p ∧ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∧ r  

### Distributive Laws
p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)  
p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)  

### Identity and Domination Laws
p ∨ F ≡ p  
p ∨ T ≡ T  
p ∧ T ≡ p  
p ∧ F ≡ F  

### Inverse Laws
p ∨ ¬p ≡ T  
p ∧ ¬p ≡ F

## Conditional Statements

- Implication: p → q  
- Converse: q → p  
- Contrapositive: ¬q → ¬p  
- Inverse: ¬p → ¬q  
- Biconditional: p ↔ q  

---

## Types of Propositions

- Tautology: Always true (p ∨ ¬p)  
- Contradiction: Always false (p ∧ ¬p)  
- Contingency: Depends on truth values (p ∧ q)  

---

## Rules of Inference

Rules that allow deriving conclusions from premises logically.

---

## Predicate Logic

Predicates describe properties using variables.

Example: P(x) ∧ Q(x)

### Quantifiers
- ∀x P(x): For all x  
- ∃x P(x): There exists x  

### Important Equivalences
∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ≡ ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x)  
∃x(P(x) ∨ Q(x)) ≡ ∃xP(x) ∨ ∃xQ(x)  

---

## Combinatorics

Combinatorics deals with counting, arrangement, and selection.

### Permutation
P(n, r) = n! / (n − r)!

### Combination
C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n − r)!)

### Binomial Theorem
(x + y)ⁿ = Σ (nCr xⁿ⁻ʳ yʳ)

### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
|A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ| = Σ|Aᵢ| − Σ|Aᵢ∩Aⱼ| + ... + (−1)ⁿ⁺¹|A₁∩...∩Aₙ|

---

## Set Theory

A set is an unordered collection of elements.

Example: {1,2,3}

- a ∈ A, a ∉ A  
- Equal Sets: Same elements  
- Subset: A ⊆ B  

### Cardinality
|S| gives number of elements.

### Power Set
P(S) contains all subsets of S.  
|P(S)| = 2ⁿ

### Cartesian Product
A × B = {(a,b) | a∈A, b∈B}  
|A×B| = |A| × |B|

---

## Set Operations

- Union: A ∪ B  
- Intersection: A ∩ B  
- Difference: A − B  
- Complement: Aᶜ  

### Laws of Sets
Idempotent, Domination, Identity, Associative, Distributive, De Morgan’s Laws apply.

---

## Multiset

Allows duplicate elements.

Example: {a, a, b, c, c, c}  
Size = sum of multiplicities.

---

## Relations

A relation R ⊆ A × B.

- Domain: all first elements  
- Range: all second elements  

Number of relations on set A = 2ⁿ²

### Types of Relations
Reflexive, Symmetric, Antisymmetric, Asymmetric, Transitive

### Closures
- Reflexive Closure  
- Symmetric Closure  
- Transitive Closure  

---

## Equivalence Relation

Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive

### Equivalence Class
[a] = {x ∈ A | (a,x) ∈ R}

Either [a] = [b] or [a] ∩ [b] = ∅

---

## Partial Order Relation

Reflexive, Antisymmetric, Transitive

### POSET
(A, R)

### Hasse Diagram
Graphical representation of POSET.

### LUB and GLB
- LUB = Supremum  
- GLB = Infimum  

---

## Lattice

A poset where every pair has LUB and GLB.

Types:
- Bounded Lattice  
- Complete Lattice  
- Distributive Lattice  

---

## Group Theory

A group (G, +) satisfies:
- Closure  
- Associativity  
- Identity  
- Inverse  

### Semigroup
Closure + Associativity

### Monoid
Semigroup + Identity

### Subgroup
Subset that is also a group

### Cyclic Group
Generated by one element  
All subgroups are cyclic.

---

## Graph Theory

- Complete graph edges: n(n−1)/2  
- Bipartite graph edges: m×n  
- Sum of degrees = 2×edges  
- Minimum edges for connected graph = n−1  
- Euler graph: at most two odd-degree vertices  

### Tree
Connected, no cycles, edges = n−1

### Spanning Trees
Complete graph: nⁿ⁻²

### Planar Graph
n − m + f = 2  
m ≤ 3n − 6  
m ≤ 2n − 4 (no triangles)

- Every bipartite graph is 2-colorable  
- Perfect matching in K₂ₙ = (2n)! / (2ⁿn!)  
- Complete matching in Kₙ,ₙ = n!
